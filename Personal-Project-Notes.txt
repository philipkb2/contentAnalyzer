Social Media Monitoring -- How It Works:
Sentiment Analysis can be performed on text as short as one sentence, making it perfect for social
media. Posts are analyzed individually to determine how people are talking about topics of interest (your
brand, your products, events, public figures). The results can be aggregated to find trends and signals.
    Personality Insights compliments Sentiment Analysis by providing insight into the people involved in
the conversation. By studying the authors of social posts, you can answer questions such as “Are people who
like our product outgoing?” and “What type of personality seems most likely to recommend our competitors?”

If you are analyzing a document written by someone else then this will give you an idea of their preferred representational system. This may help you tailor your writing in order to build rapport.
